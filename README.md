# Classification-of-movement
Assistive coaching systems are actively being integrated into various sports. They enable a better understanding of aspects of oneâ€™s physical form and techniques that require improvement, leading to enhanced sports performance and reduced injury risk. This paper investigates the informativeness of gyroscope data in the development of a component of such a system, specifically the module for classifying types of movement in sports fencing. It is shown that data obtained from the gyroscope are sufficiently informative to classify atomic movements. During the experimental study, gyroscope signals from four professional fencers were recorded for six characteristic fencing movements. Based on the gathered data, a regression model was trained, capable of classifying types of movements for both right-handed and left-handed athletes.
